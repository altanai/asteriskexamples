# Asterisk 

Asterix open-source telephony Server can be used to build multitude of applications . 

## Installation and setup 
check the asterisk available version  from https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/
use wget to download 

```commandline
wget https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-17.6.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf asterisk-17.6.0.tar.gz
```

 libpri library allows Asterisk to communicate with ISDN connections.
 
 DAHDI ( Digium Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) library allows Asterisk to communicate with analog and digital telephones and telephone lines / PSTN
 
 dahdi-linux 
 ```commandline
wget https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/dahdi-linux/dahdi-linux-current.tar.gz
tar -xvf dahdi-linux-current.tar.gz
```
dadhi-tools
```commandline
wget https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/dahdi-tools/dahdi-tools-current.tar.gz 
tar -xvf dahdi-tools-current.tar.gz
``` 
 
Remember you make to make and install DAHDI and libpri before building asterisk 
 ```commandline
make
sudo make install 
make config 
```

## Build asterisk  
 
SIP stack ina Asterisk  
- chan_sip SIP channel driver ( old)
- chan_pjsip

Build with later using 
```commandline
cd asterisk-17.6.0
./configure --with-pjproject-bundled --with-jansson-bundled
```
output
```

You can use safe_asterisk to enable auto restart after crash thus minimizing downtime . It also creates core dump file .

One can continue on the sandbox environment to run the modules I describe in this repo . 

## configuration 

Listen address for SIP in sip.conf , Listen on

specific IPv4 address.      Example: bindaddr=192.0.2.1
specific IPv6 address.      Example: bindaddr=2001:db8::1
IPv4 wildcard.              Example: bindaddr=0.0.0.0
IPv4 and IPv6 wildcards.    Example: bindaddr=::

## Modules 

asterisk/modules support teh modular structure of Asterisk

## Applications

such as 
app_dial.sio
app_playback.so
app_voicemail.so

## Resources 

Custom applications such as res_musiconhold.so

## Codecs and Formats 

convert media on disk and channel 

## Cli commands 

Interface with asterisk and issue commands

Other interface for asterisk control are AMI ( Asterisk AManger Interface) and AGI ( Asterisk Gateway Interface ) which operate on APIs like PHP , C++ , Java , Perl

## Applications 
Custom application that can be built - Call Queue monitoring 

Add a dialplan in extensions 
```
[internal_users]
exten => 6000,1,Answer()
exten => 6000,2,Wait(1)
exten => 6000,2,Wait(1)
exten => 6000,3,Playback(hello-world)
exten => 6000,4,Hangup()
```
Reload and see the dialplan 
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> dialplan reload
Dialplan reloaded.
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> dialplan show 
...
[ Context 'internal_users' created by 'pbx_config' ]
  '6000' =>         1. Answer()                                   [extensions.conf:866]
                    2. Wait(1)                                    [extensions.conf:867]
                    3. Playback(hello-world)                      [extensions.conf:868]
                    4. Hangup()                                   [extensions.conf:869]
```

During Call 
```commandline
*CLI>   == Setting global variable 'SIPDOMAIN' to '192.168.1.114'
  == Spawn extension (internal_users, 6000, 5) exited non-zero on 'PJSIP/7000-00000000'
```

## debugging 

**Issue1** Cannot find sip commands 
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> sip show peers
No such command 'sip show peers' (type 'core show help sip show' for other possible commands)
```
\
**solution** First check is module is installed 
```commandline
module show like chan_sip.so 
```
When module is installed 
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> module show like chan_sip.so
Module                         Description                              Use Count  Status      Support Level
chan_sip.so                    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)        0         
1 modules loaded
```

when modules is not installed 
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> module show like chan_sip.so
Module                         Description                              Use Count  Status      Support Level
0 modules loaded
```

If module is not loaded Make sure Asterisk is configured to load the module via modules.conf
There may be a case that res_pjsip is loaded inplace of chan_sip
```
; Do not load chan_sip by default, it may conflict with res_pjsip.
noload => chan_sip.so
```
In that case chan_pjsip would be loaded 
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> module show like chan_pjsip
Module                         Description                              Use Count  Status      Support Level
chan_pjsip.so                  PJSIP Channel Driver                     0          Running              core
1 modules loaded
```
On forcing loading of chan_sip module
```commandline
altanai-Inspiron-15-5578*CLI> module load chan_sip
Loaded chan_sip
SIP channel loading...
